&lt;div&gt;The Authority’s attention has been drawn to the activities of a company operating within the Seychelles under the name “1xbet” with the following website &lt;a href=&quot;https://1xbet.com/en.&quot;&gt;https://1xbet.com/en.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The FSA would hereby like to inform members of the general public and all relevant persons as to the fact that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1xbet is not licensed by the FSA to conduct interactive gambling services (online live betting, casino and slot games) in and/or from within the Seychelles nor does it hold any other licence as may be issued pursuant to the Seychelles Gambling Act 2014 (&quot;Gambling Act”).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The FSA Seychelles urges members of the public to exercise caution if soliciting or partaking in any services or products being offered by 1xbet and to be advised that they will be doing so at their own risk.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;This notice in no way implies that 1xbet is not licenced in another jurisdiction but impresses on the fact that they presently do not hold a licence under the Gambling Act.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The FSA reminds the public that should they continue to utilize or engage in services or products provided by the aforementioned company, as they are not licensed by the FSA, they are not protected under the Seychelles Gambling Act and other relevant laws, which govern such entities licensed in the Seychelles.&lt;/div&gt;
